\section{Operating systems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{What is the overall purpose of an operating system?}
  \item \textit{How can the operating system make several programs execute seemingly "at the same time"?}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Processes}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{What is the difference between a program and a process?}
  \item \textit{What does the acronym PCB stand for?}
  \item \textit{Whats the purpose of the PCB?}
  
\end{enumerate}

\section{System calls}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{What is the overall purpose of the system call concept? }
  \item \textit{Why are exceptions important when implementing system calls?}
  \item \textit{Why are interrupts important when implementing system calls?}
  \item \textit{Why can't we simply use ordinary function calls when implementing system calls?}
  \item \textit{What is the difference between the system call interface and the actual system calls?}
  \item \textit{A common pattern when using system calls is for the caller to first allocate storage and then pass a pointer to this storage to the system call - why?}
  \item \textit{Some system calls are blocking, i.e., the caller will block until some condition is met. How can blocking system calls be implemented efficiently?}
  
\end{enumerate}

\section{fork()}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{What is the purpose of the fork() system call?}
  \item \textit{How many times does fork() return?}
  \item \textit{What are the possible return values of fork()?}
  \item \textit{What actions must be taken by the kernel when executing the fork() system call?}
  
\end{enumerate}

\section{exit()}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{What is the purpose of the exit() system call?}
  \item \textit{What actions must be taken by the kernel when exectuting the exit() system call?}
  \item \textit{If an exit status is given to exit(), how is this information handled by the kernel?}
  \item \textit{How is exit() related to the  "zombie" process state?}
  
\end{enumerate}

\section{wait()}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{What is the purpose of the wait() system call?}
  \item \textit{What are the possible return values of wait()?}
  \item \textit{How can the exit status of a terminated process be retrieved using the wait() system call?}
  \item \textit{Hos is wait() related to the  "zombie" process state?}
  
\end{enumerate}

\section{exec()}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{What is the purpose of the exec() family of system calls?}
  \item \textit{When calling a function or a system call, normally you will return back to the caller again. Is this true for the exec() family of system calls (motivate)?}
  \item \textit{If a parent process creates a pipe, then calls fork() and the child calls exec - will the child be able to access the pipe?}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Signals}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{What is the purpose of signals?}
  \item \textit{What is a signal handler?}
  \item \textit{What are the limitations of signals?}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Pipes}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{What is a pipe?}
  \item \textit{How are file descriptors used together with pipes?}
  \item \textit{How do we create a pipe?}
  \item \textit{How can we make two processes share a pipe in order to communicate with each other?}
  \item \textit{How do we read data from a pipe?}
  \item \textit{What happens if we read from a pipe with no data?}
  \item \textit{What happens if we read from a pipe with no writers?}
  \item \textit{How do we write data to a pipe?}
  \item \textit{What happens if we write to a full pipe?}
  \item \textit{What happens if we write to pipe with no readers?}
  \item \textit{Why is it a good practice to all ways close unused file descriptors?}
\end{enumerate}

\section{dup2()}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{What is dup2() doing to file descriptors?}
  \item \textit{How can this be useful?}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hidden state}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{ How is it possible for rand() to return different values on consequitve calls?}
  \item \textit{A parent process calls srand() to seed the pseduo random generator (PRNG) and then uses fork() to create a number of child processes. Each child generates a sequence of "random" number by calling rand(). Can you make any predictions (motivate) about the sequences?}
  
\end{enumerate}

\section{Reentrant code}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{What is meant by reentrant code?}
\end{enumerate}
